This is the frontend application for the Quiz and Course Platform built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Question Builder Enhancements**: Bulk CSV/Excel imports and AI-assisted question generation
- **Dashboard**: Personal dashboard with statistics and progress
- **Admin Panel**: Administrative features for content management

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

The frontend communicates with the Laravel API backend located at `/api.quiz`. In Docker, API requests are proxied through Next.js using the `/backend` rewrite which targets the `backend` service on the internal network. For local non-Docker usage, you can point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` directly to `http://api.quiz.test/api`.
